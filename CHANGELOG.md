[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Energy acquisition now consumes EVHardware's coherent `EnergySnapshot`; duplicate SOC,
  range, power, temperature, odometer and charge property ids were removed from the app.
- Charging-session integration and tyre-pressure reads moved to EVHardware. The local
  car-property adapter is now unused by production and supports debug diagnostics only.

## [2.1.8] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **The weather answers arrived all along; they were being thrown away.** EVHardware read the
  reply parcel one int too early — a nullable parcelable argument is written as a presence flag
  and then the object, so every field landed in the next one's place, the payload's type tag
  never matched, and a reading that had arrived was reported as unreadable. That is precisely
  the `map=bound` with nothing behind it that 2.1.7 timed the query to explain. Tracking
  EVHardware 1.6.0 fixes it, and `ext_temp` has a working source that does not depend on
  catching a broadcast at the right moment.

## [2.1.7] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **The weather broadcast is real but rare, and the app forgot it between restarts.** The action
  is confirmed: the head unit's weather app sends `com.saicmotor.weather` when *it* refreshes,
  not on any cadence this app can ask for. 2.1.6 listened and gave up between refreshes, and the
  app is restarted every time the driver opens it to look at the log — which is the worst moment
  to start waiting. The last reading is now kept across restarts for two hours, and the platform
  is asked at start-up and on every temperature-less upload for a held broadcast, which costs
  nothing and answers immediately if the weather app sends its update sticky.

### Changed

- **`map=bound` in 2.1.6 corrected the release note that shipped with it.** That release said the
  map service never bound; the log showed the binder alive and the *query* returning nothing,
  which is a different failure with a different fix. The map query is now timed, and the elapsed
  time appears in the log — the query is bounded by a two-second wait inside EVHardware, so a
  null returning at once was refused or answered undecodably while a null returning at the bound
  is a service that did not answer in time. Nothing outside the library distinguishes them, and
  guessing which one it was is what produced the wrong note.
- The broadcast reading now carries its age in the log (`bcast=Toulouse/12min`): where a value
  came from does not say whether it still describes the day.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **`ext_temp` was still absent: the weather service 2.1.5 added never bound.** The log added in
  that release is what showed it — every upload listed `ext_temp` among the omitted fields, with
  no place name beside the fix. Meanwhile the head unit's own status bar shows a temperature
  continuously, and it does not get it from that service: it gets it from a broadcast. The
  uploader now listens for the same one (`com.saicmotor.weather`) and prefers it, falling back
  to the map service query and, before either, to the vehicle sensor on a car that has one.

  The payload's shape is unverified, so it is read by searching for any key that names a
  temperature at any depth rather than by a fixed layout, in either unit, whether the value
  arrives as a number or as a string. A parser written against a guessed layout fails silently
  and looks exactly like the bug it was meant to fix.

### Added

- **The temperature's source, on every log entry** — `[temp car]`, `[temp bcast:Toulouse]`,
  `[temp map:...]`, or when nothing answered, why each one did not: `[temp none bcast=no
  broadcast yet map=unbound]`. A payload that arrives but carries no readable temperature is
  reported with a sample of what it did carry, which is what a fixed parser would have hidden.

### Notes

- Position is not the problem, and the log settled it: fixes arrive from the `fused` provider,
  accurate to about a metre and seconds old, with the coordinates the car is actually at. An
  address that looks wrong on ABRP is not coming from what this app sends.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **`ext_temp` reached ABRP as 0 degC, and 2.1.4 did not change that.** Guarding the value only
  stopped the app sending a zero; ABRP shows 0 for an absent `ext_temp` too, so the symptom was
  identical. The cause is the car: this VHAL does not implement `ENV_OUTSIDE_TEMPERATURE`, so
  there was never a vehicle reading to correct. The outside temperature now comes from the head
  unit's own weather service (`com.saicmotor.mapservice`, already bound by EVTasker through
  `SaicWeather`), queried for the car's position and cached for 10 minutes — the query can reach
  the network from inside the head unit and it blocks the upload thread while it does. The
  vehicle sensor is still preferred whenever a car does implement it.
- **A GPS fix could be dropped for being stale when its age was never knowable.** 2.1.4 aged
  fixes on the monotonic clock, but a provider that does not stamp `getElapsedRealtimeNanos()`
  leaves it at zero, which dated every fix to the last boot and would have discarded all of
  them — a staleness guard turning into a position blackout. An unstamped fix is now kept, and
  a fix from a clock that jumped forward is no longer aged negatively.

### Added

- **The payload summary is in the app's Log tab, not only in logcat.** 2.1.4 put it where a car
  with no adb attached cannot show it. Each attempt now carries the fields it sent and the ones
  it left out, which is the only thing that separates "ABRP shows 0" from "the app sent 0".
- **Position diagnostics on each entry:** the fix's age, its accuracy, the provider that
  supplied it, and the place name the weather service answered for. ABRP reverse-geocodes the
  address it displays from the same coordinates, so a place name that disagrees with it means
  the coordinates are wrong, and one that agrees means ABRP is showing something older.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **The car was reported where it used to be, not where it is.** A GPS fix had no expiry, so
  `lastLocation` kept whatever it last held. Two paths turned that into a wrong position:
  start-up seeded it from `getLastKnownLocation()` unconditionally — with a cold receiver that
  is the *previous* drive's fix, uploaded stamped with the current time for the first minutes
  of every trip — and once the receiver stopped delivering (garage, tunnel) the same fix was
  resent forever. A fix is now dropped past `max(5 min, 3 x upload interval)`, measured on the
  monotonic clock rather than the wall clock, which the head unit adjusts from GPS itself.
  Position is then omitted and ABRP keeps its own last point instead of being moved backwards.
- **`ext_temp` could be sent as a freezing day the car never measured.** It was the only
  temperature without a plausibility guard, while `cabin_temp`, `batt_temp` and `hvac_setpoint`
  all had one. A VHAL that does not implement `ENV_OUTSIDE_TEMPERATURE` returns `0.0` rather
  than throwing, so the read looked successful and `ext_temp: 0` went to ABRP's consumption
  model. Now guarded like the others (-50..80 degC, exactly 0.0 excluded). A genuine 0 degC is
  lost with it — the cheaper of the two errors, and the same trade-off already made three times.

### Added

- **A one-line summary of every upload in the log.** `TelemetryPayload.summarize()` renders
  what actually went on the wire, derived from the JSON itself so it cannot drift from the
  payload it describes, and names the fields that were left out. That is what separates a read
  that failed from a read that returned something wrong — the question this release started from.
  Dropped stale fixes are logged with their age.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-08-25

### Removed

- `android.car.permission.CAR_POWERTRAIN` — declared since the first release and never used.
  The app reads no powertrain property: park state comes from the vendor gear services through
  EVHardware, and nothing here touches the standard AAOS gear or ignition properties the
  permission guards. Dropped from the manifest and from the security allowlist.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **The uploader starts on a car that has not granted position yet.** The service declares the
  `location` foreground type, and since Android 14 every declared type is checked against the
  permissions held at the moment it enters the foreground — so a fresh install, or a boot
  before the app had ever been opened, killed the service in its own `onCreate` before the
  first tick. The type is now claimed only while the permission behind it is held, and the
  activity asks for the permission *before* starting the service rather than after.
- **Outside and cabin temperature reach ABRP again.** Both were declared and read since 2.1.0
  but never requested at runtime, so both properties answered as unreadable and were dropped
  from every payload.
- **The service notification is visible.** `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` was declared and never asked
  for; the only status the service has was being dropped silently on Android 13 and later.
- A permission granted while the service is already running now takes effect at once instead
  of at the next boot.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Restored stable release builds by approving the read-only odometer, tyre-pressure and
  battery-capacity permissions in the security allowlist.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- The telemetry payload now carries every ABRP field this vehicle can actually answer:
  pack temperature, usable capacity, state of energy, odometer, climate setpoint, the four
  tyre pressures, and `kwh_charged` for the running charge session. `kwh_charged` has no
  counter in the VHAL, so it is integrated from the instantaneous charge rate on every
  sample tick — including the ticks the cadence policy throttles away — and resets when a
  new session starts.
- Range falls back to the standard AAOS `RANGE_REMAINING` property when the SWI68 vendor
  cluster answers nothing, so range now reaches ABRP on other firmware generations too.

### Fixed

- Three vehicle property IDs were off by one and had silently disabled their fields: the
  charge-port read was the flap (`EV_CHARGE_PORT_OPEN`) rather than the cable
  (`EV_CHARGE_PORT_CONNECTED`), and the cabin-temperature ID was not a VehiclePropertyIds
  value at all, so `cabin_temp` had never been sent.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- Telemetry no longer stops while the car is charging. Charge detection relied solely on
  the standard AAOS charge-port property, which this VHAL need not implement: a plugged-in
  car reading "unplugged" was treated as parked and idle and throttled to one sample every
  15 minutes, so ABRP never saw the SOC curve it needs to size a charging stop. The charge
  rate and, failing that, a rising SOC on a parked car are now used as fallbacks.
- `power` is now signed ABRP's way — positive leaving the battery, negative charging. The
  vehicle's charge rate uses the opposite convention and was being forwarded unchanged, so
  ABRP saw a fast-charging car as discharging.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-15

### ⚠️ Breaking — existing users must install once more

- Renamed from MG4ABRPUploader to **EVABRPUploader**, and the application id changed from
  `com.mg4.abrptelemetry` to **`com.evsuite.abrp`**. Android treats this as a different app,
  so it does not update an existing install: it is added next to it and starts with no ABRP
  credentials and no permissions. Re-enter your ABRP token here, confirm telemetry reaches
  your account, and only then uninstall the old app.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Reworked the main screen as three swipeable ABRP, Service and Log pages with a fixed,
  high-contrast top navigation bar and consistent selected-state accessibility.
- Updated the shared EVHardware dependency to the current catalogue and diagnostics layer.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Corrected stable release packaging and metadata.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Add an in-app About surface with project information and a repository QR code.

### Security

- Keep unstable OTA downloads in private cache, validate every redirect, verify the APK
  signing certificate, and require an explicit successful `pm install` result.
- Remove the public-download update path and its storage permission exposure.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Prefill the ABRP API-key input with the public open-source telemetry key while
  preserving any custom key already saved by the user.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- API key and token inputs are masked by default, with a password visibility
  toggle sized for in-car touch targets.
- CONTRIBUTING.md, DESIGN.md and this CHANGELOG.
- Security issue template.

### Changed

- Adopted the EVSuite design system. Colour, spacing, type and component styles now
  come from shared tokens (`values/colors.xml`, `values/dimens.xml`,
  `values/styles_ev.xml`), generated by `tools/sync-tokens.mjs` and specified in
  [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
- Theme is now `Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar`: the app follows the vehicle's
  day/night setting, and the light palette is held to the same 7:1 contrast floor as
  the dark one.
- `ev_outline` raised from `#4A525B` to `#7A8492`. The old value was 2.25:1 against
  `ev_surface`, below the 3:1 floor for non-text UI, so the card border it was meant
  to provide effectively was not there.
- Launcher icon replaced with the EVSuite adaptive icon: charcoal tile, white glyph
  with a single red accent, product caption. Vector only — the five legacy density
  bitmap buckets are gone.
- README restructured to the shared EVSuite skeleton; table of contents is now
  generated by `tools/sync-docs.mjs`.
- Repaired bug/feature issue templates (duplicate YAML key, field ordering).
