/**
 * Restarts uploading when the head unit powers up.
 *
 * BOOT_COMPLETED alone was not enough. An MG4's head unit rarely cold-boots: switching the
 * car on usually resumes it, and the resume is announced with QUICKBOOT_POWERON instead.
 * Users reported uploading never starting with the car, and this is why — the app was
 * waiting for a broadcast their car does not always send. The other MG4Suite apps already
 * listen to the whole family; this one now does too.
 *
 * MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED is in the list for a different reason: an update stops the service,
 * and nothing else would bring it back until the next power cycle.
